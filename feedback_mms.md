## Overview:

Looks great!  Makes we want to go back and watch more Office episodes.

You coded a working game after only two weeks of coding.  That's pretty cool.

Bronze level?  Check!  You executed well and didn't reach too far.  I'd like to see some of this duplication extracted to reusable methods next time.

Keep up the good work.

## Rubric:

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

    **Exceeds Expectations**. Nice and clear user stories.  It was the lovely commit messages that pulled you into Exceeds.  Kudos.

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

    **Meets Expectations** You built it.  It works.  We're only two weeks in!  Good jobn fighting for the in-place input.  If you have a tad less duplication, this would be an "exceeds".  

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

    **Meets expectations** I'm sure you had some fun with the questions.  The game play and graphics are simple and clear.  You have one of the few with directions.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

    **Does not meet expectations** Knowing the effort you must have applied to get 681 lines of code to play well together, I'd love to make this an exceeds -- but it's jsut too much.  Maintenance will not be fun.  Review my code comments in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/malissaromero/The-Office-Trivia-Game/pull/1) (prefixed with my initials - "mms").

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_

    **3: Exceeds expectations** You go girl!  I don't like the duplication, but you supported your choices AND delivered a working app.  Kudos.

Good job.  Keep it up.  You're on the right track.
